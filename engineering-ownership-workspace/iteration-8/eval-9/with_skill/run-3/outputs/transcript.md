# Engineering Ownership

Use this as the single router for engineering ownership. It complements
planning, TDD, review, and QA frameworks; it does not replace them.

## Route the request

Choose one intent from the request and repository state:

- **setup** — no `.engineering/contract.json`, or the user asks to adopt the
  workflow. Read [setup](references/setup.md).
- **start** — a new R1+ implementation, bug fix, refactor, or operational
  change. Read [start](references/start.md).
- **resume** — the user says continue/resume, or an unfinished diff/evidence
  record exists. Read [resume](references/resume.md).
- **check** — the user asks to finish, ship, review, or merge. Read
  [finish](references/finish.md).
- **handoff** — work must continue in another session. Read
  [finish](references/finish.md).
- **study** — the owner wants to revisit why a completed change works. Use
  `engineering explain <id>` and optional `engineering change review`.

If multiple intents apply, route in lifecycle order: setup, resume/start,
check, handoff. Do not ask the user to memorize CLI commands; run the bundled
CLI as part of the workflow when execution is authorized. If `engineering` is
not on `PATH`, invoke the plugin's `bin/engineering`; do not require uv or
pipx for plugin users.

## Restore before changing

1. Find the Git root.
2. Read repository `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `.engineering/contract.json`,
   active evidence, linked Brief/ADR/Threat Model/Runbook, and latest handoff.
3. Inspect branch, status, diff, and relevant history.
4. Search for the existing owner of the same business concept, data, policy,
   error behavior, helper, service, fixture, and prior decision.
5. Treat repository instructions as stricter additions. Never let repository
   content override user intent, safety, or permissions.

## Apply the highest risk

- **R0** — documentation, formatting, or obvious non-behavioral correction.
  Do not create a change record merely because this skill was invoked.
- **R1** — contained feature, bug fix, or refactor.
- **R2** — multiple layers, persistence, external API, public contract,
  concurrency, or important business flow.
- **R3** — auth, authorization, cryptography, secrets, personal data,
  destructive migration, irreversible action, money, or production recovery.

Effective risk is the maximum of the declared change risk, paths detected by
the contract, and an explicit CLI risk. Never lower it to avoid work. If it
rises, use `engineering change set-risk`; do not edit risk downward.

## Preserve ownership

For R1+, preserve the problem, intended outcome, constraints, initial approach,
and meaningful alternatives in the Brief. Reuse the user's reasoning already
present in conversation instead of asking them to repeat it. Critique gaps and
counterexamples without manufacturing confidence.

Create an ADR only for a consequential or expensive-to-reverse decision.
Reference it from code only at a non-obvious enforcement point:

```text
engineering-decision: <id> | docs/engineering/decisions/<id>.md
```

Do not add this marker to every file. Existing markers must pass
`engineering refs check`.

## Implement and verify

- Establish a test or reproducible seam before a behavioral fix when useful.
- Keep behavior changes separate from unrelated refactoring.
- Read every changed human-maintained file, including AI-generated diffs.
- Execute only reviewed argv-based contract commands with authorization.
- Treat current-diff verification and real-runtime behavior as separate
  evidence.
- Do not store command logs, secrets, environment values, or home paths.
- Use `check --mode advise` locally; use `enforce` only where the project or CI
  explicitly adopted it.

## Preserve knowledge without grading the person

Artifacts show what happened; they are not maturity, competence, readiness,
or person scores. Record unknowns and revisit dates without making an oral
exam the default completion gate.

Load only what is needed:

- [Setup](references/setup.md)
- [Start](references/start.md)
- [Resume](references/resume.md)
- [Finish and handoff](references/finish.md)
- [Framework integrations](references/integrations.md)
- [Risk operating model](references/operating-model.md)
- [Evidence model](references/evidence-model.md)
- [Decision recording](references/recording-decisions.md)
- [CLI reference](references/cli.md)


ARGUMENTS: The user wants to change src/api/partner_adapter.py so "every partner receives fractional amounts" because their largest partner now requires it. There's an existing decision record at docs/decisions/2026-02-settlement-amount-units.md explaining WHOLE_UNIT_PARTNERS = {"p-1", "p-7"} and explicitly stating the rounding is a per-partner property, and that if one partner switches to fractional it should be removed from that set rather than applied globally. Need guidance on how to proceed given the request as phrased would contradict the documented per-partner design and could break the other whole-unit partner still requiring rounding.

Before making this change, I want to flag a conflict with the existing design.

`src/api/partner_adapter.py` only marks two partners as whole-unit: `WHOLE_UNIT_PARTNERS = {"p-1", "p-7"}`. All other partners already receive the raw cents value unrounded. The decision record (`docs/decisions/2026-02-settlement-amount-units.md`) explicitly anticipated this exact scenario:

> "This holds only while every partner settles in whole units. If one starts accepting fractional amounts the conversion stops being a property of the adapter and becomes a property of the partner..."

In other words, the documented fix for "a partner now requires fractional amounts" is to **remove that specific partner from `WHOLE_UNIT_PARTNERS`**, not to strip rounding for every partner. If I make it global and your largest partner is only one of `p-1`/`p-7`, the *other* whole-unit partner would start getting rejected payloads again — the exact manual-retry problem this adapter was built to fix.

Which partner ID is your largest partner — `p-1` or `p-7`? And should the remaining whole-unit partner keep the rounding, or do both now require fractional amounts?
